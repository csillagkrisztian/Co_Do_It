# "Now you got my attention, tell me more..."

<strong>CO*DO_IT</strong> is created by a passion to immediately teach newfound knowledge to others in a fun environment. Interested in \_teaching* your friends _how to code_? Or maybe _practicing_ your already _polished skills_? How about challenging your best friend on a code <strong>battle</strong>? You will find your path on my dear app.

<br>

# "How did you make this?

- ReactJS
- ReactRouterDom
- Redux
- Socket io 🦾
- Express
- Sequelize && Sequelize-cli
- React Bootstrap 🦾
- NodeJS
- PostgresQL

`🦾 These technologies I learned to use within a week`

[Used this front-end template to speed up development](https://github.com/Codaisseur/react-redux-jwt-bootstrap-template)

Every misstep or lack of knowledge was filled in by every Junior Developers dear friend Google, StackOverflow, Youtube, Udemy and of course the Official Documentation of each technology
<br>

# "Why did you make this?"

The goal is to add more fun to the already exciting world of coding, for those that find it hard to get into it. This project was also a test of my knowledge that I accumulated during the Codaisseur Academy as a soon to be Full-Stack App developer.

### This project was a test to see what I can do in the following circumstances

- practice full-stack web development
- use what I learned at Codaisseur Academy
- learn new technology on our own
- showcase and document our development skills :
  - wireframes
  - data model
  - user stories oriented approach
  - agile
  - clear git version control

# "So as a user what can I do?"

- `Battle with friends`
- `Teach others`
- `Own a profile`
- `Practice Coding`
- `Create New Coding Exercises as teacher`
